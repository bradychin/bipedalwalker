# BipedalWalker

This project demonstrates a reinforcement learning agent trained to walk in the [BipedalWalker-v3](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v3/) environment using [Stable Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).

## Features
- PPO algorithm with customizable network architecture.
- Training loop with logging and policy evaluation.
- Visualization of trained agent in the environment.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- gym, pybullet, pybullet_envs
- torch
- stable-baselines3

Install dependencies:
```bash
